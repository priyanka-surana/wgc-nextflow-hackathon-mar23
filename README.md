Thank you for registering for the upcoming Nextflow / Nf-core Hackathon from 27 â€“ 29 March. The event will take place at the Chestnut Suite in Hinxton Hall. The room should be open from 8am every morning.

1. In consultation with your manager and team, plan what you want to work on and add them as issues to this GitHub repository. Try to make your tickets as atomic as possible with detailed description. Add labels to make it easier to search and organise in the project board. You can still create tickets without joining as collaborator but will not be able to add labels. (You should receive a separate invitation today to join the repository as a collaborator. If you have not received your invitation, please let me know. Since we are spread across different organisations and teams, it is not possible to use one of the existing project boards.)

2. EBI, Sanger, and Campus communication teams are covering our event. To make sure your work is represented correctly, please send a short description of the work your team does, how Nextflow/pipelines support that work and finally what you hope to accomplish during this hackathon. This is optional but a great opportunity to showcase your work. They will also be around taking pictures during the event, please let me know if you would like to be excluded.

3. Tables are assigned by groups (documentation, modules, pipelines, subworkflows, infrastructure) and you can choose based on what you are working on. We are currently looking for additional table captains, someone willing to answer questions and help newcomers. If you have some Nextflow/Nf-core experience, please consider volunteering. It should not take much of your time but would greatly enhance the experience of those new to Nextflow or hackathons.

4. The current schedule is below. The welcome would be a chance to hear what the different tables/groups are working on. And in the daily wrap up we would highlight the work started/completed/progressed. Refreshment breaks and lunch times should provide a chance to interact with other participants.

Please let me know if you have any comments, questions, or concerns.
